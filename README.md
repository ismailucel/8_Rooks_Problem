# 8_Rooks_Problem
Eight Rooks will be placed on a Chessboard in a way not to take each other. The location of the rooks will be determined using a random number. After the first rook is placed, the location of the second rook will be determined randomly, but the necessary control will be made to ensure that the rooks do not take each other. If there is a situation of taking each other, the location of the last rook will be determined randomly again. At each stage, a drawing in matrix view will be provided to the screen. Similar operations will be carried out until all eight rooks have been placed.
